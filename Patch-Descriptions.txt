ForceFCC:
This patch will force the TX power to FCC limits.

RemoveUpdateForce:
This removed the ForceUpdate function of the app

RemoveFwUpgradeService:
This will stop FW Upgrade Service to start, this way the app does not know which firmware the aircraft is running. This might be useful for people on old firmware versions

Offline login:
Will remove the real login and give you a bogus one. Enter at least one char into username and one into pass. (thx to artu-ole)

remove Onlinefunction:
This will replace all urls inside the code with bogus ones, so the app cannot connect to the internet. Here Maps is excluded, so you can still have maps! This patch HAS to be applied together with the Offline login or you won't be able to login anymore! (thx to err0r4o4)

soPatch:
This patch is automatically applied with "remove Onlinefunction". Will patch the libSDKRelativeJNI.so to stop it from calling home!

will remove Google API's (keep them if you want social!)

remove Social:
This will remove all the social network stuff. FB, Twitter blablab (if you want this you should keep googleapi's too!)
